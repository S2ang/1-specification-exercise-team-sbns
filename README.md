### Names

 - **Andrew Xu (Third Year Student at NYU).**
	- I focused my questions around his needs for using Albert as well as some of the problems that he currently has. This would allow us to address those issues when making the mobile app version. 
	
### Goals Or Needs
 - Finding which classes are offered each semester. 
   - Some classes are not offered every semester and sometimes they are with different professors. Albert allows students to see the current classes offered for each semester and the professors who are teaching them.  
 - Checking if classes are on waitlist and how many people are on the waitlist. 
   - Sometimes classes get canceled or filled up before students can sign up. Albert tells students which classes are available as well as how many students are waitlisted and which position the student is on the waitlist.  
### Problems or Frustrations
 - The public course search UI is very lengthy and difficult to use on mobile and on desktop.
   - This is a problem that I faced as well. The public course search for mobile has a massive UI issue with that you are required to scroll for a large amount of time before you can find the classes that you want to sign up for. 
   - For example, higher level computer science classes are all the way on the bottom, so you are forced to scroll through all the lower level classes before you can find the section of classes that you need. 
   - A possible fix for this problem would be to collapse all the classes. So rather than seeing all the available classes for CSCI-UA 2, you would just see a button labeled CSCI-UA 2. Then on click you would see the available classes. This would drastically reduce the amount of scrolling needed and allow students to find classes faster.
